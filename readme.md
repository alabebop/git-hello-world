# Learn to git-it!

This repository is a learning project created as I went along with the git-it workshop (https://github.com/jlord/git-it) found in nodeschool (http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) by [Jessica Lord @jlord](http://jlord.us/).

It was easy and welcoming to follow, informative, and also great fun. I was excited to see the robot merged my branch and thrilled to see my github ID appear in the page of people who completed (http://jlord.us/patchwork/). Great incentive!

Now it is only logical to review what I've learnt, put them down to words and let them sink in, before the weekend's gone and before my memories fade.


## Learning notes

Following is what I've picked up on my way, ordered in accordance with the eleven chapters of the workshop. 

1. GET GIT - configure git
	* To check git number
	```
	$ git --version
	```

	* To configure user name and email
	```
	$ git config --global user.name "Xiaoli Shen"
	$ git config --global user.email "alabebop@gmail.com"
	```
